To receive development build updates, pull from https://github.com/Dhranios/Luigi-s-Mansion-3DS-Remake into the "`Luigi's Mansion/datapacks/Luigi's Mansion 3DS Remake`" folder.

Official add-on for [Luigi's Mansion](https://github.com/Dhranios/Luigi-s-Mansion), see that repository for more information.

WARNING! This data pack will always load itself right after the Luigi's Mansion data pack! Do not create other add-ons that want this position as well (make them after this one instead).

# Changes
Ghost behavioral changes the add-on applies:
* Using a flashlight on a temper terror, flash or blue blaze makes them "smug", laugh and then disappear, rather than ignore and continue moving/attacking; the functions for being smug exist in the base map.
* Portrait ghost rank is also determined by top vacuum damage not just largest pearl grabbed; if you deal 90 damage in one go, you get gold, even if you leave the pearl behind.
* Portrait ghosts have platinum rank for 140 damage in 1 go, or less than 5 damage for bosses in the hidden mansion.
* Strobulb flashlight type added, which ghosts can react to.

Room -4 is the gallery, regardless of add-on or not. The add-on will simply teleport players in the old gallery to the new one, and never start ticking the old one.

The new gallery's functions are under `luigis_mansion_3ds_remake:room/gallery/`.

The hidden mansion is replaced, but only a small amount of the original files are overwritten to do so, allowing other add-ons to change both hidden mansions separately.

If you make any add-ons that change the hidden mansion, overwrite the file with the following commands to support both versions:
`execute unless score #3ds_remake Loaded matches 1.. run function <vanilla version>'
`execute if score #3ds_remake Loaded matches 1.. run function <3ds version>'

The new hidden mansion's functions are under `luigis_mansion_3ds_remake:room/hidden/`.

The new hidden mansion simply re-uses the `luigis_mansion:normal` dimension.

Portrait ghosts in the hidden mansion will re-use the normal mansion behavior, aside from the slightly different function calls and non-mirroring AI changes (such as chauncey's battle).

# Portrait battle details
Portrait battles simply check for the following:
* If a portrait ghost had spawned, and a portrait ghost has been dying, and there's none left, the battle was a success.
* If a portrait ghost had spawned, and no portrait ghost has been dying, and there's none left, the battle will fail.
* If the player is dead, the battle will fail.
* If the battle was a success, an empty marker ghost is spawned to prevent the room from lighting up, and unlocking doors.

Additionally, during portrait battles, the following is done:
* All furniture searching is prevented.
* `pearl_dropper` is removed from all ghosts.
* Players who didn't select to battle are set to spectator mode.

The lowest health and fastest time scores are grabbed from the builtin `lowest_health_moment` and `in_mansion_time` values respectively.

The fastest time value has an additional 5 seconds removed, as that's the time it adds to clear the battle.

Portrait ghosts store in which `mansion_data_index` they have been defeated, NOT `mansion_type`.

If you want the battle to be selected separately, use a new data index.
